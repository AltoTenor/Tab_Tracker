## How to Use

Once the extension is installed and activated, you will see a small icon (Tab Tracker) on the Chrome toolbar. Clicking on this icon will open the Tab Tracker popup, where you can perform various actions.

### Function 1: Save Current Tab URL

To save the URL of the current tab, simply click the "Save Tab" button in the popup. The current tab's URL will be added to the list below with a timestamp.

### Function 2: Add Custom Tab URL

If you want to add a custom URL to the list, follow these steps:

1. Enter the desired URL in the input field provided in the popup.
2. Click the "Save Input" button to add the URL to the list. The custom URL will also be displayed with a timestamp.

### Function 3: Delete All Tabs URL

In case you want to clear all the URLs from the list, click the "Delete All" button in the popup. Be careful as this action cannot be undone, and all URLs will be permanently removed.
